Superglobals
===
Predefined variables that are available in all scopes throughout a script. If
something is not in a superglobal and you want to make it global, you need to do
`global $variable`

See superglobal list
[here](http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php). 

`$GLOBALS`: all variables in global scope. 

`$_REQUEST` is a combo of `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_COOKIE`
`$_ENV` contains envrionment variables
`$_SERVER` contains info about the server
`$_COOKIE` and `$_SERVER` store info about the current user and session

Regular constants 
===
`define('CONST_NAME, 'the value goes here')`
Magic constants
===
[look at them](http://php.net/manual/en/language.constants.predefined.php)

Cookies and sessions
===

HTML is stateless (mostly! we do have html5 storage now...). Once the page has
been delivered to your browser, by default the server forgets all about you.

Netscape came up with cookies to remedy this problem. Cookies are stored in the
browser. Sessions solve the same problem, but their data is stored on the
server.

Cookies:
- are stored on the client - if you have a cluster of servers, this may be
  better (the client doesn't have to talk to the same server every time)
- have a finite lifespan
- may have a limited size
- all data must be sent with each request - the client will automatically send
  all the cookie info related to the server with every request to the server, so
  you don't want to store too much. In php this data goes to the superglobal
  `$_COOKIE` automatically.
- Only choice if you want site to remember the user tomorrow
- If you have sensitive information, use a cookie to send an id, an store the
  info in the database based on that id (not on the client)
- Dangerous? Not really. A site can only read data that it has stored. This
  doesn't stop the client from doing something nefarious though.

A cookie is set like so:
```php
    // languageprefs.php

    <?php
      if (!isset($_COOKIE['Language'])) {
        setcookie("Language", $_POST['preferred-language'], time() + 31536000);
      }
    ?>

    <form method="post" aciton="languageprefs.php">
      <select name="preferred-language">
        <option value="en">English</option>
        <option value="es">Espa√±ol</option>
      </select>
    </form>
```

After this, the "Language" cookie would be sent with every request to this web
site for a year, and you could find it in the `$_COOKIE` superglobal.

There are more parameters that let you specify that the cookie can only be sent
over HTTPS. That said, don't store sensitive information in cookies.

Sessions:
- Combo of a server side cookie and a client side cookie. Client side cookie
  contains only a reference to the correct data on the server. The browser sends
  only this reference code. The server side cookie is stored in `$_SESSION`
  automatically.
- stored on the server: better for safe information:
- you don't need to send much information with each request (just an ID)
- unlimited size
- cleaned up when the visitor closes their browser

Either way, both are for 'disposable' information. Longer term data should be
stored in the dataabase. If you store personal information in cookies, you
should encrypt it.

To use a session:

```php
session_start();
```
this tells the server sessions are going to be used. When this is called, PHP
checks whether the client has sent a session cookie. If it did, it will use that
identity to load the session data from the right session file. If not, PHP will
create a session file on the server and send an ID back to the visitor to store
in a new cookie.

You must call `session_start()` before accessing any session variables. It needs
to be at the very top of the file.

Once this is done, you can set and get any session info for the current user
using the `$_SESSION` superglobal.

You can end a session with `session_destroy()`, but the client side session
cookie will only persist until the client quits their browser.

isset vs empty 
===
`isset` checks whether an existing variable is set and is not null - this means
it will return true for an empty string variable must exist first!  

`empty` checks whether the evariable is an empty string, false, an empty array,
null, "0", 0, or does not exist, so it will return true for an empty string

Base URLs
===

On apache you can do this:
```
$_SERVER['REQUEST_SCHEME'] . '://' . $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . $_SERVER['CONTEXT_PREFIX'];
```

But you can't always rely on specific server variables. Usually this goes in a config file.

PECL vs PEAR
===

PECL = PHP Extension Community Library, written in C, can be loaded into PHP. You need admin rights, a C compiler.

Ubuntu's `php5-pgsql` installs the `PDO_PGSQL` pecl package.

PEAR = PHP Extension and Application Repository, libraries are IN php. It's a distribution/packageing system. It's possible to use it without root, but it's hard. Kind of like CPAN-hard.

Composer is awesome! We don't use it.

Talking to the DB
=====
You need the php5-pgsql package for this to work.

pg_connect() and pg_pconnect()

Both Return a connection resource needed by other psql functions.

Connecting to a postgres db takes rather more resources than connecting to a mysql db, so pg_connect is a bit more expensive than its php cousin.

If multiple calls with the same connstring are made to pg_pconnect specifically, the same connection will be returned - the connection stays around in persistent memory.

When there are a lot of simultaneous connections, we can use a connection pooler like http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgBouncer to lighten the load, but pg_pconnect performs well enough.

FPM mitigates the pooling need a bit, since the number of PHP workers is controlled, so pg_pconnect is a bit safer on FPM than mod_php or others.

```php
$connstring = "dbname=" . $config['db']['name']
. " host=" . $config['db']['host']
. " user=" . $config['db']['user']
. " password=" . $config['db']['password'];

// The persistent database connection
$GLOBALS['DB'] = pg_pconnect($connstring);
if(!$DB) die("Error: Can't connect to the database.");
```

Connecting
----
Get a connstring and pass it to pg_pconnect():
http://php.net/manual/en/function.pg-pconnect.php
check that pg_pconnect() returned !null


Write simple functions for getting projects stuff out of the database; no joins yet:

```php
function getProjects() {
  $query = "SELECT * FROM redmine_projects";
  $result = pg_query($GLOBALS['DB'], $query);
  return pg_fetch_all($result);
}

function getProjectById($id) {
  $query = "SELECT * FROM redmine_projects WHERE id = $1";
  $result = pg_query_params($GLOBALS['DB'], $query, array($id));
  return pg_fetch_all($result);
}

function deleteProjectById($id) {
  $query = "DELETE FROM redmine_projects WHERE id = $1";
  $result = pg_query_params($GLOBALS['DB'], $query, array($id));
  return pg_fetch_all($result);
}
```

Then put it in the index:
```php
  <?php
  $allProjects = getProjects();
  ?>
...
  <?php
  foreach ($allProjects as $project) {
  ?>
    <tr>
      <td><?= $project['name'] ?></td>
      <td><?= $project['description'] ?></td>
      <td><?= $project['expires'] ?></td>
      <td><?= $project['repository_type'] ?></td>
      <td><a href="detail.php">Details</a></td>
    </tr>
  <?php
  } // End foreach allProjects
  ?>
```

But we need the relation for project type, so let's add a join:

```php
  function getProjects() {
    $query = "SELECT projects.name, description, expires, repository_types.name as repository_type
              FROM projects
              JOIN repository_types
              ON (projects.repository_type = repository_types.id)";
    $result = pg_query($GLOBALS['DB'], $query);
    return pg_fetch_all($result);
  }
```

Now the page displays the actual repo type instead of the id.

Make detail links:
1. add `projects.id` to the select statement so we get ids out
2. add `detail.php?id=<?= $project['id'] ?>` to the detail url in the table.

Time to use the info on the detail page, but first make sure we have an id:

```php
if(!isset($_GET['id'])) {
  header('Location: ' . $GLOBALS['BASE_URL']);
  die(); // not all clients respect location headers
}

$project = getProjectById($_GET['id']);
```

We'll also need to modify our project fetching query to join and get the repository type.

```
function getProjectById($id) {
  $query = "SELECT projects.id, projects.name, description, expires, repository_types.name as repository_type
              FROM projects
              JOIN repository_types
              ON (projects.repository_type = repository_types.id)
              WHERE projects.id = $1";
  $result = pg_query_params($GLOBALS['DB'], $query, array($id));
  return pg_fetch_all($result);
}
```

When you echo $project['name'] to the page, it fails - why? pg_fetch_all returns an array of rows - and even though we only have one row, it's not smart enough to know that. It returns an array of one.

Change `pg_fetch_all` to `pg_fetch_array`, and you'll be able to do $project['name'] successfully.

Make new project form work:

Notice that our repository type dropdown contains nothing. We need to get database info about repo types that are availablei in there.

Add a function:

```php
function getRepositoryTypes() {
  $query = "SELECT * from repository_types";
  $result = pg_query($GLOBALS['DB'], $query);
  return pg_fetch_all($result);
}
```

Use this to populate the dropdown:

```php
$repositoryTypes = getRepositoryTypes();
...
<select>
  <option value="">None</option>
  <?php
  foreach ($repositoryTypes as $repositoryType) {
  ?>
      <option value="<?= $repositoryType['id'] ?>"><?= $repositoryType['name'] ?></option>
  <?php
  }
  ?>
</select>
```

(now submit the form and dump `$_POST`)

We'll need an add function:

```php
function newProject($name, $description, $expires, $repository_type = NULL) {
  $query = "INSERT INTO projects (name, description, expires, repository_type) VALUES ( $1, $2, $3, $4)";
  $result = pg_query_params($GLOBALS['DB'], $query, array(
    $name,
    $description,
    $expires,
    $repository_type
  ));
  return pg_fetch_all($result);
}
```

We need to add a basic error check to make sure we have minimum information:

```php
    $repositoryTypes = getRepositoryTypes();

    if(!empty($_POST)) {
      if(empty($_POST['name']) || empty($_POST['description']) || empty($_POST['expires'])) {
        $message = "Please fill in a name, a description, and an expiration date.";
      } else {
        newProject($_POST['name'], $_POST['description'], $_POST['expires'], $_POST['repository_type']);
        $message = "Project created.";
      }
    }
    ?>

...
    <?php if(isset($message)) { ?>
    <p><strong><?= $message ?></strong></p>
    <?php } ?>
```

Make the delete form work:

We need a project id on this form too, so add this to the top:

```
if(!empty($_POST)) {
  if(empty($_POST['name']) || empty($_POST['description']) || empty($_POST['expires'])) {
    $message = "Please fill in a name, a description, and an expiration date.";
  } else {
    newProject($_POST['name'], $_POST['description'], $_POST['expires'], $_POST['repository_type']);
    $message = "Project created.";
  }
}
?>
```

And make sure we pass in an id from the project detail view:

```php
  <a class="button button-primary" href="delete.php?id=<?= $project['id'] ?>">Delete this project</a>
```
Now to get the id of the project to delete into the form: add a hidden input:

```php
    <form action="delete.php" method="post">
      <input type="hidden" name="id" value="<?= $_GET['id'] ?>">
      <div class="row">
        <a class="button" href="index.php">No, cancel</a>
        <input class="button button-primary" type="submit" value="Yes, delete it">
      </div>
    </form>
```
And process it above (BEFORE the `$_GET` check)

```php
if(!empty($_POST['id'])) {
  deleteProjectById($_POST['id']);
  header('Location: ' . $GLOBALS['BASE_URL']);
  die();
}
```
